                    Float pool and internal agency management has become increasingly important in healthcare organizations in order to effectively manage staffing needs and shortages associated with the continuously changing workforce. Float pools provide a cost-effective solution that not only allows hospitals and other healthcare facilities to reduce clinical labor costs but maintain high-quality patient care and employee engagement levels. Equipping care facilities with a float team of experienced professionals – each possessing specialized knowledge and licensing credentials – promises to create reliable solutions for safely managing staffing levels when patient volume is trending upward.

        To maintain the highest levels of employee satisfaction and quality patient care, it is important for healthcare systems to create a flexible float pool that includes not only dedicated float nurses but also an internal per-diem pool and on-demand per-diem talent. This allows facilities to staff their operations in the most cost-effective way while also regularly providing excellent nursing care that meets the needs of their patients. Doing this builds trust between employers and employees, leading to increased job security and loyalty that in turn creates more stability in staffing when unpredictable fluctuations in patient demand occur.
